## Evaluations of Learning Algorithms for Vision based Robot Control
Visual information is an important information for robots operating in unstructured environment. This project aims to evaluate several learning algorithms for vision-based robot control. Both shallow and deep learning techniques will be tested on an industrial manipulator, and comparisons will be made.
